function attempt=subdecode(message)
%This function uses frequency analysis to attack and decode messages
%encoded using a /substitution cipher/ which exchanges each letter of the
%alphabet for another. Unlike the famous "Caesar Shift" cipher, which
%"shifts" the letters of the alphabet along by a certain amount, giving
%just 26 possible ciphers, this has no specific order, giving 26!
%possibilities. The function is very unlikely to work first time but,
%depending of the length of the text, highly likely to get the letters "T"
%and "E" correct. From here the user may spot an error in the decoding,
%such as "TQE" which is obviously "THE", and the function offers them the
%chance to swap the offending letters as often as is required. After a few
%simple cases, the encrypted message is generally broken.
%It removes all punctuation and case from the original
%text.
